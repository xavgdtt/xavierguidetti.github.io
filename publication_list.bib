abstract = {Producing coatings of repeatable quality is a crucial objective of any coating process, including atmospheric thermal spraying (APS). With the existing output regulation methods used in APS, it is common to see significant variations in the coating characteristics of sequentially coated parts, which are insufficient to meet the ever-stricter requirements of new coating applications. Therefore, this paper suggests a novel process output regulation method that improves repeatability of coating characteristics by combining advanced monitoring solutions and machine learning approaches. It uses Gaussian process models and Kalman filters to adjust process input parameters between sequentially coated parts based on feedback of gun voltage, ensemble particles' temperatures, deposition efficiency, and application rate. The method enables not only compensation of process degradation but more generally minimizes the long-term differences in the process state between different coating runs by using a system-state-aware process model to track the temporal changes of the coating system. The developed method was tested in an industrial environment and compared to the most commonly used approach in APS of spraying sequential parts with the same process input parameters, and to the approach of adjusting the process inputs based on the gun voltage. The developed method produced coatings with smaller variation and closer to the target compared to the other two approaches.}

  abstract       = {With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches for 3D~reconstruction have gained popularity. However, unlike for images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D~reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D~reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of learning-based 3D tasks.},
